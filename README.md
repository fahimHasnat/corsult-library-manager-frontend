# Corsult Library Manager - Frontend

This guide will help you set up and run the frontend of the Corsult Library Manager, a web application for managing library operations with user and admin roles.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the frontend, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: [Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- **npm**: npm comes bundled with Node.js, so installing Node.js will also install npm.

## Installation

### 1. Install Project Dependencies
Navigate to the project directory and install the necessary dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
```
### 2. Run the [Backend Server](https://github.com/fahimHasnat/corsult-library-manager-backend)
This will connect the database and provide the APIs in the URL: localhost:8001

### 3. Run the Frontend Server
```
npm run dev
```

This will start the NextJS frontend server and make the UI accessible at 
```http://localhost:3000```.

Admin Credential:
